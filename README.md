## Model
The models are pre-trained on the MIT Place Pulse 2.0 dataset. The backbone of the models are vision transformer (ViT) pretrianed on ImageNet (ViT_B_16_Weights.IMAGENET1K_SWAG_E2E_V1). 

In the ViT heads, 3 Linear layers with ReLU activiation are added for classification.



## How to run the model
Install packages from requirements.txt

` pip install -r requirements.txt` 

Change the file path in *eval.py*

```
model_load_path = "./model"   # model path
images_path = "./test_image"      # input image path
out_Path = "./output"     # output path
```
Run the file *eval.py*
